## A highly moddable 3D voxel engine
GVOX Engine is a moddable cross-platform voxel engine designed to give
freedom to creators, be they artists or game developers.

Currently, it's nowhere near any usability, but there are demos available
on [this repo's releases page](https://github.com/GabeRundlett/gvox_engine/releases), as well as on [Gabe's Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/FPVNeej5sr).
