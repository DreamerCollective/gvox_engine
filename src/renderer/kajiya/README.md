## Kajiya Renderer

Kajiya Renderer is a renderer created by Embark Studios written in Rust and HLSL. I have ported it to C++ and GLSL, and of course to use Daxa's render graph. There is a lot of code in here that is modified from the original Kajiya renderer, to make it fit into Gvox Engine nicely, but the essential parts are nearly just direct ports.
